# Social-Network

![License Badge](./public/assets/images/badge.svg)

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a list of friends. This application utilizes the [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) database structure, [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing and the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) ODM.

This application also utilized the JavaScript Date object to format timestamps. Since the application currently does not have a Front-End deployed, we are using Insomnia Core to demonstrate the Back-End functionality and how the [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) structure helps us create a database that is concise and quick to set up.
